## ðŸ“œ Pipeline overview

We adopted a two-step computational strategy to dissect non canonical TCA cycle (Arnold Cycle) activity across cancer cell lines ().
In the first module, we used constraint-based metabolic modeling to infer the activity of the Arnold Cycle from gene expression data. Specifically, we extracted transcriptomic profiles from 513 cancer cell lines cultured under standardized conditions and reconstructed a cell-specific metabolic model for each line based on the ENGRO2.2 core network. Reaction constraints were individualized by computing Reaction Activity Scores (RAS) using Geneâ€“Proteinâ€“Reaction (GPR) rules, and these scores were used to rescale flux boundaries to reflect the transcriptional context of each cell line. To comprehensively explore the space of feasible metabolic states, we performed unbiased flux sampling on each transcriptome-constrained model using a corner-based sampling algorithm. This allowed us to approximate the distribution of steady-state flux configurations consistent with mass balance and expression constraints, without assuming predefined cellular objectives. From these sampled flux distributions, we derived two complementary metrics to quantify Arnold Cycle activity: `Cycle Propensity`, defined as the fraction of flux samples in which the three reactions (*SLC25A1*, *ACLY*, *MDH1*) of the Arnold Cycle are simultaneously active (Fig. 1b); and `Cycle Flux Intensity`, which captures the average flux through the bottleneck reaction when the cycle is active.

In the second module, these *in silico*â€“derived metrics were used as training labels for supervised machine learning models. To predict `Cycle Propensity` and `Cycle Flux Intensity` from transcriptional features beyond the metabolic network, we trained regressors using expression data from non-metabolic genes. After model training, we performed feature selection to identify robust predictors of Arnold Cycle activity, thereby uncovering broader transcriptional programs associated with its engagement.
